# Import a Nodejs image that runs on top of an Alpine image.
 
RUN mkdir -p /home/app
# This command will create a subdirectory called /app in the /home directory of the Alpine image
 
WORKDIR /home/app
# This command will set the default directory as /home/app.
# Hence, the next commands will start executing from the /home/app directory of the Alpine image. 
 
COPY package*.json ./
# To copy both package.json and package-lock.json to the working directory (/home/app) of the Alpine image.
# Prior to copying the entire current working directory, we copy the package.json file to the working directory (/home/app) of the Alpine image. This allows to take advantage of any cached layers.

# Install cross-env globally
RUN npm install -g cross-env


RUN npm install
# This will create a node_modules folder in /home/app and
# install all the dependencies specified in the package.json file.
 
COPY . .
# Here “.” represents the current working directory.
# This command will copy all the files in the current directory to the working directory (/home/app) of the Alpine image.
 
EXPOSE 3002
# Make the application available on port 8080. By doing this, you can access the Nodejs application via port 8080.
 
CMD ["npm", "start"]
# One important thing to notice here is that “RUN” executes while the image creation process is running
# and “CMD” executes only after the image creation process is finished.
# One Dockerfile may consist of more than one "RUN" command, but it can only consist of one "CMD" command.
